Configuration
=============

Configuration files for *gallery-dl* use a JSON-based file format.
For a (more or less) complete example, see gallery-dl.conf_.
A list of all available configuration options and their
descriptions can be found in configuration.rst_.

*gallery-dl* searches for configuration files in the following paths:

+--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
| Linux                                      | Windows                                  |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+
|* ``/etc/gallery-dl.conf``                  |*                                         |
|* ``${HOME}/.config/gallery-dl/config.json``|* ``%USERPROFILE%\gallery-dl\config.json``|
|* ``${HOME}/.gallery-dl.conf``              |* ``%USERPROFILE%\gallery-dl.conf``       |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------+

(``%USERPROFILE%`` usually refers to the users home directory,
i.e. ``C:\Users\<username>\``)

Values in later configuration files will override previous ones.


Authentication
==============

Username & Password
-------------------

Some extractors require you to provide valid login-credentials in the form of
a username & password pair.
This is necessary for ``pixiv``, ``nijie`` and ``seiga`` and optional
(but strongly recommended) for ``exhentai`` and ``batoto``.

You can set the necessary information in your configuration file
(cf. gallery-dl.conf_)

.. code::

    {
        "extractor": {
            ...
            "pixiv": {
                "username": "<username>",
                "password": "<password>"
            }
            ...
        }
    }

or you can provide them directly via the
:code:`-u/--username` and :code:`-p/--password` or via the
:code:`-o/--option` command-line options

.. code:: bash

    $ gallery-dl -u <username> -p <password> URL
    $ gallery-dl -o username=<username> -o password=<password> URL

OAuth
-----

*gallery-dl* supports user authentication via OAuth_ for ``flickr`` and
``reddit``. This is entirely optional, but grants *gallery-dl* the ability
to issue requests on your account's behalf and enables it to access resources
which would otherwise be unavailable to a public user.

To link your account to *gallery-dl*, start by invoking it with
``oauth:<site-name>`` as an argument. For example:

.. code:: bash

    $ gallery-dl oauth:flickr

You will be sent to the site's authorization page and asked to grant read
access to *gallery-dl*. Authorize it and you will he shown one or more
"tokens", which should be added to your configuration file.

Server
======

To enable server feature of gallery-dl, you have to install the required package.

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install gallery-dl[server]

After that you can visit the server (default on 127.0.0.1:5000)
